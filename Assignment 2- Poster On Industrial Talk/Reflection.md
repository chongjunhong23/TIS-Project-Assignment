# Assignment 2- Poster On Industial Talk
## Reflection
From the industrial Talk by Clarity Techwork, a Fintech company which is based in Singapore and Malaysia, I have learnt about various jobs and positions related to ICT. Throughout the talk, we are introduced to the job scope and routine of the positions. For examples, jobs and position related to ICT are QA Testing Analyst, Junior UI/UX Designer, Junior Web Dev and Junior Android Dev. We were shared with the experience about the ICT jobs by the talkers. Since technology keeps on changing at a high rate, thus it is important for us to be a self-learner who has the passions in keep gaining more knowledges about ICT to keep ourselves updated with the rapid change of technologies. Besides, I also gained some useful advices from the industrial talk. One of them is that we need to give attention to detail when we do anything. This is crucial for us to realize some hidden knowledges or details and help us reduce our mistakes or even avoid them.
### Suggestion On Improvement
Speakers from Clarity Techwork have shared us with their valuable experiences on how they mastered and gained from their job post and i have gained a lot of benifits from the information they shared. In my opinion, i hope that more details on the process the speakers works on to make themselves adapt to their job post can be shared.
