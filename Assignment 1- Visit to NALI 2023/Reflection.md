# Assignment 1- Visit To NALI 2023
## Reflection
From the visit to NALI 2023, I have learnt a lot of useful knowledges. The activities in NALI 2023 have given a lot of benefits to students. A lot of extra knowledges based on the topic or project presented can be gained by just participating in NALI 2023. From this activity, I have learnt about the importance of adaptation and resilience in the process of learning. In this modern world of globalization, technology keeps on changing on a rapid pace. Thus, it is importance for us to adapt ourselves to the changes so that we know how to use the new technologies or tools to benefit ourselves. For example, from one of the presented poster in NALI 2023 about artificial intelligence, we can learn that one of the most popular tool nowadays, ChatGPT has brought a huge impact on the modern education. Thus, we as user have to adapt ourselves in order to maximize its function to make our work more efficient and use it correctly as a tool to assist us but not replace us.
