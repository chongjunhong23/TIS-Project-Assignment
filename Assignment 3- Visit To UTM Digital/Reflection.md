# Assignment 3- Visit To UTM Digital
## Reflection
From the talk about UTM Digital held on 10th of December 2023, I have leant bout the core function or UTM Digital. The core functions of UTM Digital are to develop and implement new applications, upgrade existing application, ensure the ICT infrastructure is always available to support application platform developed and finally support the implementation of Digital Lifestyles through development of the latest innovation technology. Besides, by visiting UTM Digital, I gained knowledges about the departments sorted in UTM digital and functions of each department. In there, we are introduced to different departments and their functions. For example, from the interview with Mrs Aslinda Binti Mohamed Aris, a Senior IT Officer, I have learnt that digital care unit of UTM Digital play role in receiving and tackling the ICT issues faced by students and staffs.
