# Lab- PC Assemble
## Reflection
From the lab activity which is PC assemble carried out on the 3rd of December 2023, I have learnt the step on how to dissemble a PC and reassemble it with the guide of lab assistants. Firstly, lab assistant demonstrate to us the steps on disassembling a PC. First step is to open the case of PC, follow by disconnecting all the cables inside the case. Then, take out the power supply, follow by the RAM from the RAM Slots, the HDD and finally the CPU Fan. According to the steps demonstrated, we reassemble the PC with our teammates. From this activity, I also learnt the importance of teamwork. With the help of teammates, we manage to memorize the steps and detail demonstrated and finally complete the assembling of PC successfully. We each assigned with different works and helped out each other throughout the process. Besides, I also learn that good communication is the key of high work efficiency.
