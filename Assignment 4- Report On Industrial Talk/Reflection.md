# Assignment 4 
## Reflection
From the industrial talk by Ms. Qistina Batrisyia Binti Azman Shah, a professional AI operation, I have learnt the overview of system development, its history, its process and technology and tool. For example, we were introduced to 7 stages of system development which are planning, Analytics, design, development, testing, implementation and finally maintenance. From this talk, I have realized that it is important for us to practice continuous learning since the technologies nowadays keep updating at rapid pace. Keep ourselves updated and make sure we can adapt ourselves with new programming languages, frameworks and tools are important to keep ourselves competitive in this rapid advancing era. Besides, I also gained useful tips and advices from Ms. Qistina. We need to embrace ourselves with positive values such as determination and confidence as they are the keys to become a decent system developer.
### Suggestion On Improvement
During the talk, speaker have given and delivered us with a lot of useful tips and advices.In my opinion, speaker can also share more of his or her experiences on the process and hardworks in becoming a successful system developer since there will be a lot of challenges and obstacles throughout the journey due to the rapid changing of ICT nowadays.
